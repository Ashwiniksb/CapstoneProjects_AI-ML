This is a car price prediction project. The purpose of this project was to predict the resale value of cars in the market according the trend for different cars with different features.
In this hands-on project, I have identified the key features responsible for prediction, made sure to explore the data in and out, identify the need to clean data. 
This clean data was then used to train various regression and regularisation models.
